Simple website based to-do list application to gain introductory knowledge to creating full stack web development projects. 

# Software / libraries used:

To set up website:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install node, and npm (may be one installation depending on OS)
3. run the command "npm start"
4. A localhost window should automatically appear in browser with your local port. If not try going to http://localhost:3000/

2. Double click current tasks to edit.

# Versions:
There is both a function based and a class based version and are seperated by two source folders found in todo-app/functionBased or todo-app/classBased

# Further implementation
I have considered looking into adding multiple pages, hosting it on a free web server or gh_pages. I would like to improve the style as it is simple, but in this case simple might be best.
